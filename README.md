### Web Scraping
#### Web scraping is the process of scraping or pulling out the data from the website using an automated process.

### Tools

#### Python
#### Python is the most popular language for web scraping as it can handle most of the process easily. 

#### Beautifulsoup
#### Beautifulsoup is a very popular Python library that is highly suitable for web scraping as it creates a parse tree that can be used to extract data from HTML on a website.

#### Requests
#### Requests is a library for making HTTP requests. It retrieves the HTML data that the server sends back and stores that data in a Python object.

### Steps
#### Inspect the HTML structure of your target site with your browser’s developer tools
#### Decipher the data encoded in URLs
#### Download the page’s HTML content using the Python requests library
#### Parse the downloaded HTML with Beautiful Soup to extract relevant information
#### Build a script that fetches data from the Web and displays relevant information in your console
#### With the help of the pandas library extract that data into an Excel file

### Outcome
#### In this project, we have given the skill you want to search the job having that skill and it will filter out the jobs and extract the data into an Excel file.
